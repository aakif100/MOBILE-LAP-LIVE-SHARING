<br>
The reason im creating a repo about this is because "live-sharing" being simple to set up and a very useful tool,still i have seen many asking me how to do it like "should i downoload a software","is extensions required","why are youtube videos about this not working for me"...
<br>
well i have an answer for you..AND ITS PRETTY SIMPLE TO SETUP

## REQUIREMENTS:

1)your laptop
<br>
2)your mobile(or any other electronic gadget)

## STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED:


1)NOW WE HAVE TO SET UP THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR PHONE AND THE LAPTOP:
-Turn on your phone hotspot and connect it with your laptop
-keep your internet connection on in your phone

2)First open up the command prompt(cmd)
3)in the cmd enter:
 ```bash
   ipconfig
```

4)now in the cmd,scroll down to the end and under "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi:" check the "  IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . :"
<br>
 (IPV4 Address representation: abc.dfc.as.wer)

 5)now go to your mobile browser(chrome preffered) and in the search bar type your IPV4 address and then the local host address which is OPENED (ie the file has to be opened and should be running)

 ## EXAMPLE:
  -(YOUR IPV4 ADDRESS):(localhotstnodenumber)(file location)
  <br>
  -(443.444.44.444:6060/src/index.html) ->representation purpose only
